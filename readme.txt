This is a RTS of sorts with the main feature being the ‘open world’ nature of it. The size of the map is effectively limited only by the amount of disk space one is willing to allow it, as well as the time and memory required for running it. 

This game uses an external library: Pillow. For instructions on installing Pillow, please go to https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.

To run this, first ensure that python is installed. After that, please make sure test.png is in the same folder as final.py. Then run final.py.
